Project 2: Handwritten Digit Recognition with a Simple CNN


CONTRIBUTORS: Afia Owusu-Forfie and Martin Moreno


## Project Overview

This project focuses on the development and understanding of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
 for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. 

- Setting up a Python project environment
- Performing data collection and preprocessing
- Designing and refining a CNN architecture
- Conducting model training and evaluation
- Executing results analysis and model optimization
- Preparing the model for deployment


## Developed/run in Jupyter notebook
## Dependencies can be found and installed with requirements.txt

- Project aims to build a model utilizing TensorFlow and Keras
- Optimized with hyperopt
